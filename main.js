👉 Write your kata here! 
The unthinkable has happened - Skynet has attacked, and the apocalypse has had an apocalypse. 
All messages are scrambled and appear to be not only containing many non-letter characters, but are also reversed.
Earth's last hope is YOU! You must decrypt the top secret messages to HQ, removing all non-letter characters, 
and reversing them to read correctly. If you don't succeed then all is lost...

For example - "e3lp45ma!xe n1a" should become "an example" 

Top secret message #1 is "h156t75e1et y^^56n12a!!!!g5o6h99999a1m 15d::n19791979e-----i1313rf89lr1ig y0000m"
Top secret message #2 is "n457ee+=+=rg t000000ser^^^^^^^^up!!!! f88888*o t90909egg!un><><><>< a\ d)(na???h latr33333333\|/om y0m n;i er_-eh d###lo!h .I. e*b t#i dl09090909u123456123oc"

//👉 Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:
export default function uncorruptTheString(corruptedString){

return correctString
};
